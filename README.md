Product Engineer with 9 years of experience. I started a career in software engineering at 16. I worked at a Swiss college for 4 years, building products from ideation to launch.

Later on, I co-founded a US startup that went on to raise $1M. I architected and built a scalable video platform API with paid subscriptions and hired our first employee.

For the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve been building and shipping products at startups.
