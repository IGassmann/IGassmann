I'm a Product and DevOps Engineer with a passion for startups.

I started a career in software engineering in Switzerland. While working there, Iâ€™ve built web and mobile applications, and designed network and server infrastructures.

Five years later, I graduated from an entrepreneurship bootcamp and jumped from being an intern at a US startup to being a founder of one. We raised about 1M dollars and shipped a consumer product for video content creators.

I enjoy being surrounded by people who are always questioning and curious. Who appreciate products that have been done with a deep concern for quality. Not only at the superficial level, but also behind the scenes.
