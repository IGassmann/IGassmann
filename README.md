I'm a Product and DevOps Engineer working at startups.

I started a career in software engineering 8 years ago in Switzerland. While working there, Iâ€™ve built web and mobile applications, and designed network and server infrastructures.

Five years later, I graduated from an entrepreneurship bootcamp and jumped from being an intern at a [US startup](https://lbry.com/) to being a founder of [one](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/odeon). We raised about 1M dollars and shipped a [consumer product for video creators](https://odeon.tv/).

I enjoy being surrounded by people who are always questioning and curious. Who appreciate products that have been done with a deep concern for quality and attention to detail. Not only at the superficial level, but also behind the scenes.
